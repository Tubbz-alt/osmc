Operating system for Minecraft programs
=======================================

This is a placeholder for a developing idea. Here is the idea, to tease you a little bit!

I'm going to build a huge huge multi storey building, with lots of rooms in it.
Each room will be the same size. In the middle of the building will be the Minecraft lift
from Adventure 10 of "Adventures in Minecraft".

You'll be able to prototype a room design inside a special "portacabin". Here you can
build blocks normally by placing them to build your room. An option on a menu will allow
you to save and restore this room to a disk file.

Secondly, you'll be given a programming API just like mcpi, to run scripts inside that room.
Your script will start running from the moment the player walks into the room, and stop running
when they exit the room.

Your scripts will be sandboxed, so that it is impossible for your script to affect the world outside
of your room.


Once you have prototyped your room and room script in the portacabin, you'll be able to upload 
it to some web service, where it will be loaded via a floor-planning system into the huge
tower block. Each room will be submitted by different people. It will be a community developed
building that you can walk around and explore all the rooms by going up and down in the lift.

The purpose of this idea is to develop something big where each part is written by someone
else in the community, and for your scripts to set a challenge inside your room. Visitors will
enter the room, and try and complete your challenge. It could be to find some treasure, to
collect some blocks, to solve some puzzle, or to find a way to exit the room in a time limit.

* The portacabin, a hollow shell (Adventures in Minecraft ch3, house building)
* lighting the portacabin or rooms ("The Turner Prize Room" script I wrote)
* geofencing room entry and exit (Adventures in Minecraft ch2, the rent game)
* room save and load format (Adventures in Minecraft ch6, Duplicator room, 
  with added field for extraData)
* Building something much taller than the Minecraft world (Adventures in Minecraft ch8,
  Alien Invasion including teleporter)
* Building a structure with sloping edges (Adventures in Minecraft ch7, pyramids)
* sandboxing scripts (something new!)
* The lift (Adventures in Minecraft ch10, without hardware, but with walls and sliding doors
  using minecraftstuff Shape object to move doors)
* floorplan building (Adventures in Minecraft ch6, tipchat, a list of room names and program names)
* Starting and stopping scripts (something new!)
* Which type of building? Look all through Adventures in Minecraft for some secret hints
  planted in a number of the chapters!
* controlling the lift (Tkinter user interface panel)

That's enough teasers for now! Keep watching!
