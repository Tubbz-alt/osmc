QUESTIONS

Reply to me as a github issue or a tweet to @whaleygeek
These are open questions to the community

1. How many rooms should the building have

2. How big in blocks (x,y,z) should the rooms be?

3. What is the smallest room (x,y,z) that would still be practicable to build in

4. How many rooms tall should the building be? Should the virtual size of the building
   be bigger (e.g. by playing a trick with teleporters to a hidden underground room)
   or should the rooms really be in the building?

5. Do you want a time limit to run while in the room, and the user to be ejected after that
   time limit. Do you want this to be fixed, or configurable for your room?
   
6. The plan is to offer the portacabin as a download so you can prototype your rooms.
   Do you like this idea?
   
7. The plan is to collect together a few hundred contributed rooms from schools and gamers
   over a period, and then offer this as a single download that you can run on your own
   computer
   
8. Is there anyone out there that would be interested in hosting a server version of it,
   and to deal with the "safety" issues to allow others to use it in a safe way?
   
9. For those under 13 interacting in schools, (not allowed to use github/twitter),
   can your school think of a way that they could contribute safely? e.g post your code on
   your school blog, perhaps?
